## March 21

I decided on my project and searched through github to try and find data sets on Olympic swimming results throughout the years.

## March 23 Beginning of Class

I spent a lot of time trying to find a data set that will work. Once I found this data set I was able to load it into R. I then worked through trying to make the variables how I want them in the data set. For example the competition name is not the same throughout all the variables and I would like to be able to group together all Olympic Games, but the city is listed in the name. So, it is difficult to find a way to fix this. I also brainstormed just how in general I want my app to look, so I knew what I needed my variables to look like.

I began putting information into my R app. I worked on attempting to get the tabs up and running and am working through connecting clicking on tabs to filtering particular data, however I am not sure if this is possible so I am still working through that.

## March 28 Beginning of Class

In between the last two classes I worked on the best way to show my data visualizations and decided on a sort of template to follow. I created the majority of the inputs that will be used in this app. I also messed around with the templates and decided where it would be best to put the tabs and what exactly I wanted the tabs to represent. I also played around with the data to start being able to visualize the data in the app.

During this class I fixed a few of the inputs so that they make more sense when choosing the variables. I also began looking at creating visualizations to put into the tabs. I made a base visualization that I am just trying to connect to the data in the shiny app. I have been working through how to fix my app so that I could possibly only have certain year input options when a particular series is selected. I am not sure if this is possible however.

## March 30 Beginning of Class

In between the last two classes I focused mostly on the format I want my app to be in. I was having a lot of issues with the different series inputs because I wanted to be able to change the year depending on the series (and I wanted the series to all have separate tabs). So, I figured out how to do this by making a separate data set for each series. I also worked on creating a new visualization in the app. I chose not to add every single series yet (because it is all copy and paste once I do anyways), so that I can do it when the visualization is actually ready how I want it to be.

## March 30 End of Class

During class today I focused on figuring out how to get a plotly graph into the shiny app and reviewed how to make a shiny app in general. I was able to change the plot already in my app into a plotly graph so the user can read the graph more clearly. I also began to work on creating a map for a tab in my app, however I haven't figured out how to combine the data sets for it because the labeling is off so I am working on that as well. 

## April 4 Beginning of Class

In between the last two classes I began adding the last of the tabs, however after adding some I decided to keep two of the types of series out because they only had data from one year. I then continued to work on creating a map for my app. I figured out how to combine the data sets, but they still won't combine because it says they are too large to combine, so I am still working through this. I may opt out of adding a map or possibly make smaller data sets, so it will be easier to combine. 

## April 4 End of Class

During this class I was mainly working through issues with the data visualizations I would like to make. I am working through changing NA values so that I can make a graphic that shows the time_behind. I am also working through combining the map data sets still (but it still doesn't work even with a smaller data set). I edited the tabs so they are now all set and just need to add more visualizations to each tab. This means the base of my project is done and now it's just adding good visualizations to the app.
