I decided on my project and searched through github to try and find data sets on Olympic swimming results throughout the years.

I spent a lot of time trying to find a data set that will work. Once I found this data set I was able to load it into R. I then worked through trying to make the variables how I want them in the data set. For example the competition name is not the same throughout all the variables and I would like to be able to group together all Olympic Games, but the city is listed in the name. So, it is difficult to find a way to fix this. I also brainstormed just how in general I want my app to look, so I knew what I needed my variables to look like.

I began putting information into my R app. I worked on attempting to get the tabs up and running and am working through connecting clicking on tabs to filtering particular data, however I am not sure if this is possible so I am still working through that.

In between the last two classes I worked on the best way to show my data visualizations and decided on a sort of template to follow. I created the majority of the inputs that will be used in this app. I also messed around with the templates and decided where it would be best to put the tabs and what exactly I wanted the tabs to represent. I also played around with the data to start being able to visualize the data in the app.
