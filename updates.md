## March 21

I decided on my project and searched through github to try and find data sets on Olympic swimming results throughout the years.

I spent a lot of time trying to find a data set that will work. Once I found this data set I was able to load it into R. I then worked through trying to make the variables how I want them in the data set. For example the competition name is not the same throughout all the variables and I would like to be able to group together all Olympic Games, but the city is listed in the name. So, it is difficult to find a way to fix this.
